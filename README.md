Algorithm requirements:
The algorithm will accommodate the following conditions:
It will work with 2-12 participants.
Participants will introduce themselves one by one.
After all the participants have introduced themselves, "Katie" will randomly nominate a participant to share one of their interests. Each nominated person will share one interest at a time.
Once everyone has shared all of their interests, "Katie" will do the partnering.
In the introduction, each participant will share their name and any additional characteristics of your choice (e.g. age, hometown, etc.). All participants will have unique names.
Each person can have up to 10 possible interests.
Each interest must have a title and optional additional information (e.g. a description, why they like it, required equipment or conditions, etc.)
